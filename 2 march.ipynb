    "Q1: **What is Matplotlib? Why is it used? Name five plots that can be plotted using the Pyplot module of Matplotlib.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a popular Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in a variety of formats. It provides a wide range of functions for creating different types of plots and charts. Matplotlib is used for data visualization and is often used in data analysis, scientific research, and presentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Five common plots that can be created using the Pyplot module of Matplotlib are:\n",
    "1. Line Plot: Used to visualize data points as connected line segments.\n",
    "2. Scatter Plot: Used to display individual data points as markers, helpful for visualizing relationships between two variables.\n",
    "3. Bar Plot: Used to represent categorical data with rectangular bars, often used for comparisons.\n",
    "4. Histogram: Used to visualize the distribution of a single numerical variable.\n",
    "5. Pie Chart: Used to represent data as slices of a circular pie, showing the proportions of different categories within a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: **What is a scatter plot? Use the following code to generate data for x and y. Using this generated data plot a scatter plot.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A scatter plot is a type of data visualization that displays individual data points as markers on a two-dimensional coordinate system. It is particularly useful for visualizing the relationship or correlation between two continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can create a scatter plot using the provided data and add title, xlabel, and ylabel to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "np.random.seed(3)\n",
    "x = 3 + np.random.normal(0, 2, 50)\n",
    "y = 3 + np.random.normal(0, 2, len(x))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create the scatter plot\n",
    "plt.scatter(x, y, label=\"Scatter Plot\")\n",
    "plt.title(\"Scatter Plot Example\")\n",
    "plt.xlabel(\"X-axis\")\n",
    "plt.ylabel(\"Y-axis\")\n",
    "plt.legend()\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: **Why is the subplot() function used? Draw four line plots using the subplot() function. Use the following data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `subplot()` function in Matplotlib is used to create multiple plots within a single figure. It allows you to arrange plots in a grid or other custom layouts in a single figure, making it useful when you want to compare multiple datasets or visualize multiple aspects of your data in one view.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can create four line plots using `subplot()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data for four lines\n",
    "x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "y1 = np.array([0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500])\n",
    "y2 = np.array([50, 20, 40, 20, 60, 70])\n",
    "y3 = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])\n",
    "y4 = np.array([200, 350, 250, 550, 450, 150])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create subplots\n",
    "plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)\n",
    "plt.plot(x, y1)\n",
    "plt.title(\"Line 1\")\n",

    "\n",
    "plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)\n",
    "plt.plot(x, y3)\n",
    "plt.title(\"Line 3\")\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)\n",
    "plt.plot(x, y4)\n",
    "plt.title(\"Line 4\")\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.tight_layout()\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will create four line plots arranged in a 2x2 grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: **What is a bar plot? Why is it used? Using the following data, plot a bar plot and a horizontal bar plot.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A bar plot (or bar chart) is used to represent categorical data with rectangular bars. It is useful for comparing different categories or groups by visualizing their values. Bar plots can be created both vertically and horizontally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can create a vertical bar plot and a horizontal bar plot using the provided data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "company = np.array([\"Apple\", \"Microsoft\", \"Google\", \"AMD\"])\n",
    "profit = np.array([3000, 8000, 1000, 10000])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Vertical bar plot\n",
    "plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))\n",
    "plt.bar(company, profit)\n",
    "plt.title(\"Vertical Bar Plot\")\n",
    "plt.xlabel(\"Company\")\n",
    "plt.ylabel(\"Profit ($)\")\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Horizontal bar plot\n",
    "plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))\n",
    "plt.barh(company, profit)\n",
    "plt.title(\"Horizontal Bar Plot\")\n",
    "plt.xlabel(\"Profit ($)\")\n",
    "plt.ylabel(\"Company\")\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: **What is a box plot? Why is it used? Using the following data, plot a box plot.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It displays the median, quartiles, and potential outliers of the data, making it useful for visualizing the spread and skewness of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can create a box plot using the provided data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "box1 = np.random.normal(100, 10, 200)\n",
